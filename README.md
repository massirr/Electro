# Electro — Electrician Takeoff to Order Tool

**Simple tool for turning electrical takeoffs into supplier orders.**

---

## What it does

1. **Takeoff to Quote** — Enter quantities, settings (rate, VAT, margin), get labor + material costs
2. **Product Mapping** — Map takeoff items to actual products (SKUs) from your catalog
3. **Order Lists** — Generate supplier-specific orders (CEBO, Rexel) ready to export

---

## The problem

Manual takeoffs → manual quotes → manual supplier orders = time wasted and errors.

This tool makes it faster and cleaner.

---

## Current status

🚧 **MVP in progress** — See [STAGES.md](STAGES.md) for detailed progress.

---

## Tech stack

- TBD (will be decided as we build)
- Focus: Simple, fast, works offline

---

## How to use (once built)

1. Enter your takeoff quantities
2. Set your pricing (hourly rate, VAT, margin)
3. Map items to products from your catalog
4. Generate and export supplier orders
