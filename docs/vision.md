## The problem

As an electrician, you spend hours on:

1. **Manual takeoffs** — Counting fixtures, outlets, panels from plans
2. **Manual quotes** — Calculating labor + materials in spreadsheets
3. **Manual ordering** — Building supplier orders by hand, checking catalogs, tracking SKUs

It's slow. It's error-prone. And it pulls you away from actual work.

## The user

**You** — An electrician who:

- Does takeoffs (manually or from plans)
- Needs to quote jobs fast and accurately
- Orders from multiple suppliers (CEBO, Rexel, etc.)
- Wants to spend less time on admin, more time installing/billing

---

## The goal

**A simple tool that turns takeoffs into supplier orders.**

Flow:
```
Takeoff → Quote → Product Mapping → Supplier Orders
```

No bloat. No "all-in-one" nonsense. Just the workflow you actually need.

---

## What success looks like

- You finish a takeoff
- 5 minutes later, you have a quote and supplier orders ready to send
- You trust the numbers
- You can reuse product mappings on the next job

---

## What this is NOT

- Not a full ERP
- Not a drawing tool
- Not a cloud subscription service
- Not a team collaboration platform

It's a **solo electrician's workflow tool.** Fast, focused, yours.
