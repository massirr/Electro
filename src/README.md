# Source Code

Your application code goes here.

## Structure (to be determined)

Once you pick your tech stack, organize it like:

```
src/
  components/    (if using a UI framework)
  utils/         (calculation helpers)
  data/          (data models, loaders)
  main.js        (entry point)
```

For now, this is a placeholder.

Start building when you're ready.
